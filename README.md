- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevYogiBlak. My actual name is Robert, but I prefer Yogi. I'm a graphic/brand designer and software developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things development and design, but mainly data science and all coding having to do with helping people. I would love to build software that saves lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, but I started with C#, which happens to be my favorite language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can. I love thinking and problem solving.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email: robertnellumsdev@gmail.com -- Instagram: yogiblak ...this is it for now.
